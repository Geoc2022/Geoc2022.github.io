<p>Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other. It is what keeps us on the ground and makes things fall when we drop them. The strength of gravity depends on two things: the mass of the objects and the distance between them. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull. The farther apart two objects are, the weaker the gravitational pull between them.</p>
