## Motif Analysis in Shostakovich 

I'm currently exploring computer analysis of motifs, building blocks of musical structure, in works of Shostakovich, one of the most preeminent Russian composers who used motifs show his double-voicing and irony in his works. [Brochure](https://george.chemmala.com/media/Project%20Brochure.pdf)

### Gap/Reasoning:
There is a lack of comparisons between different methods to find motifs.

There is also a lack of quantitative data about motifs in Shosikovich’s works because of the medium and the fact that it is hard to decipher the ironies in his work.

Therefore, it would help fill these two gaps by creating a better way to analyze Shosikovich while assessing current motif detection algorithms
